# work_os_app

This is a Practice for me by Dart and flutter,This app for daily work tasks in companies which I can add a task and remove it,The workers can add comments about their tasks, and the product manager can upload a task and specify a deadline date, also only him can change the status of the task to flag it as done., Filter all tasks which type of tasks u want to see.

  • The app use user friendly UI, with maximum performance of written code.                                                                                                           • I used Firebase Database to saved user data.
